Starting this project out based on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-web-development-django-tutorial/

Will be using a virtual environment by initially running "pipenv install"

Enter the virtual environment using "pipenv shell"

I installed django next using "pipenv install django"

Create a Django project by doing "django-admin startproject Firts_Django"

To get Django server up do the following
    1. cd Firts_Django
    2. python manage.py runserver
    3. verify server is working by going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Doing a "python manage.py help" will show a list of commands I can run against my server

To create apps within Django go to folder containing manage.py and type "python manage.py startapp {projectAPP}" where {projectAPP} is the name you want to use.

With an app created I can start to create views in views.py file inside my app directory (gfg_site_app).

Add a pointer to the views file inside a urls.py file in app directory and then include it in Django folder urls.py that is running the server itself.
